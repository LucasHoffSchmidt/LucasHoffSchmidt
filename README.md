## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Hoff Schmidt.

My journey in software development began with creating a game in C# using Unity. That experience ignited my passion for coding, and I've been expanding my knowledge ever since.

### Courses and Certifications

### Projects
Since completing these courses, I have been working on various projects, primarily using TypeScript. Currently, I am building an E-Commerce website called "Mini Market." This project is a marketplace for individuals to buy and sell reusable and affordable items.

### Interests and Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy:
- Calisthenics
- Practicing kungfu
- Playing piano
- Learning new languages
- Spending quality time with my family
