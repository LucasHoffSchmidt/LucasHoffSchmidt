## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Hoff Schmidt.

My journey in software development began with creating an endless runner game in C# using Unity as a solo developer. This experience ignited my passion for coding, and I've been expanding my knowledge ever since.

### Project Highlights
#### Adventures of Chirpie
An endless runner game I made in C# with Unity for Google Play Store, itch.io and Unity Distribution Portal. 
It features 8 different worlds with their own unique ambience, achievements, pickups, powerups, upgrades, different player characters, daily rewards, slot machine minigames and player trophies.  
I made the game using gimp for designing assets, FL Studio for music, Bfxr for sound, Unity for game development and Shotcut for making videos.

##### Trailer
This video shows a brief overview of what the game has to offer.
