# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Hoff Schmidt.

My journey in software development began with creating an endless runner game in C# using Unity as a solo developer. This experience ignited my passion for creating, and I've been expanding my knowledge ever since.

## Project Highlights
### Adventures of Chirpie
An endless runner game I made in Unity for Google Play Store, itch.io and Unity Distribution Portal. 
It features 8 different worlds with their own unique ambience, achievements, pickups, powerups, upgrades, different player characters, daily rewards, slot machine minigames and player trophies.  
I made the game using gimp for designing assets, FL Studio and Audacity for the ambience, Bfxr for sound, Unity and C# for game development and Shotcut for making videos.
