# Hi there 👋

My name is Lucas and I am a Business Analyst, specializing in python. 
I am intrigued by the driving forces behind actions. Given a choice of 3 different actions, what are the factors that make you decide that one choice is better than the others? 
How much of a choice is based purely on subjective opinion, and how much is due to influencing factors such as parents, culture and current trends? 
Initially, I may hypothesize, but through analysis, I will know.
