## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas Hoff Schmidt.

My journey in software development began with creating a [game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bHDo86nl7s) in C# using Unity as a solo developer. I used gimp for designing assets, FL Studio for music and sound, and Shotcut for making videos. That experience ignited my passion for coding, and I've been expanding my knowledge ever since.

### Courses and Certifications
I have completed several key courses that have significantly contributed to my development skills:

1. **[Software Development Fundamentals](https://coursecareers.com/explore/software-dev-fundamentals)** by CourseCareers

### Projects
Since completing these courses, I have been working on various projects, primarily using TypeScript. Currently, I am building an E-Commerce website called "Mini Market." This project is a marketplace for individuals to buy and sell reusable and affordable items.
Technologies used include React, Redux, Node, Typescript, Jest, Nodemailer and Stripe. 

### Interests and Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy:
- Calisthenics
- Practicing kungfu
- Playing piano
- Learning new languages
- Spending quality time with my family
